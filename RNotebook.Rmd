This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

data.raw <- read.csv("DelayedFlights.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE, header = TRUE, na.strings=c("","-","NA"))
#glimpse into the data
glimpse(data.raw)
#look at the missing values
missingValues <- colSums(sapply(data.raw, is.na))
missingValues[missingValues > 0]
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
